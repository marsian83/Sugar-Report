# Google Summer of Code 2024: Math Games for Sugar

During the Google Summer of Code 2024, I dedicated my efforts to developing **eight interactive math games** for the Sugar learning platform. My objective was to create engaging and educational experiences that helped learners improve their math skills through fun gameplay. Throughout this project, I focused on designing unique visual representations and assets using Adobe Photoshop, ensuring that each game not only served its educational purpose but also captivated users with appealing graphics. The development encompassed essential functionalities, which enhanced the overall gaming experience.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of game development, visual design, and educational technology while also providing an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the Sugar community. I successfully navigated the challenges and learning experiences that arose during this exciting journey, ultimately delivering a set of games that I hope will inspire and educate learners.

## List of Games Developed

### 1. River Crossing Activity
**GitHub Repo**: [River Crossing Activity](https://github.com/marsian83/river-crossing-activity)


### 2. Nim Game Activity
**GitHub Repo**: [Nim Game Activity](https://github.com/marsian83/nim-game-activity)  
  The activity consists of items arranged in rows, where each participant takes turns removing a number of these items. The participants are the user and the computer (Robot). The last person to remove an item wins the game. The AI for this game is implemented using the "Winning Arithmetic Progression," aka "Zero Nim sum," concept used by many Nim-like games. The enemy will occasionally show a message to the player, inspired by the cut-the-knot demo by Alexander Bogomolny.

  Since the aforementioned game demo makes it impossible for the player to win, it will also be true if a perfect strategy bot is implemented. Thus, adding difficulties is important. The game includes three difficulty modes: Normal, Difficult, and Impossible, where the computer has a chance to intentionally make a mistake.


### 3. Latin Square Activity
**GitHub Repo**: [Latin Square Activity](https://github.com/marsian83/latin-squares-activity)



### 4. Illusion Box
**GitHub Repo**: [Illusion Box](https://github.com/marsian83/illusion-box)



### 5. Fourier Series Visualization

### 6. Pascal Triangle Visualization
**GitHub Repo**: [Pascal Triangle Visualization](https://github.com/marsian83/pascal-triangle-visualisation)
