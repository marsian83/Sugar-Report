## ðŸ“– Detailed Activities Description

### River Crossing Activity | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sugarlabs/river-crossing-activity)
The **River Crossing Activity** is an engaging puzzle game inspired by the classic "Goat, Cabbage, and Wolf" riddle. In this game, players take on the role of a farmer who must transport his belongings across a river. However, the farmer faces a dilemma: only one item can be transported at a time, and certain items cannot be left together without supervision.

The objective is to figure out how to safely get all the items across the river without anything being lost or damaged. Players must think logically and plan their moves carefully to solve the puzzle. The game encourages problem-solving skills and critical thinking while keeping the player entertained.

With multiple themes, this version of the river-crossing puzzle offers a fresh and visually appealing twist on the classic brainteaser. Perfect for users of all ages, it is designed to challenge the mind while being fun and accessible.

### Nims Game Activity | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sugarlabs/nim-game-activity)  
The **Nims Game Activity** is a strategic, turn-based game where players take turns removing items arranged in rows. The objective is simple: the last person to remove an item wins the game. The game features a player versus computer (Robot) setup, making it a fun challenge for users.

In the game, you can customize several settings to adjust both visuals and gameplay:
- **Visual settings** allow players to change the appearance of the enemy (e.g., Robot) and the items used in the game (e.g., coins or matchsticks).

The AI for this game is based on the "Winning Arithmetic Progression" or "Zero Nim Sum" concept used in similar Nim-style games. This ensures that the computer (Robot) can employ optimal strategies to challenge players. Additionally, the game will feature difficulty levels:
- **Normal**
- **Difficult**
- **Impossible**

In the **Impossible** mode, the bot will always play perfectly, making it nearly impossible for the player to win unless they master the strategy. To balance the challenge, lower difficulty modes introduce occasional mistakes by the computer, offering a fairer chance for players.

The images below showcase concept art designed to envision how the game will look. Players will enjoy a visually appealing interface alongside strategic gameplay.

### Illusion Box Activity | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sugarlabs/illusion-box)  

The **Illusion Box Activity** is an engaging visual experiment that presents a collection of optical illusions for users to explore and interact with. The activity includes multiple illusions, each with a unique visual effect that plays with perception. Users can reveal the true nature of each illusion by pressing the spacebar or hovering over the image. The activity also features pagination, allowing users to browse through different sections, with each section containing six illusions.

Some of the illusions included are:

- **Revolving Circles Illusion:**  
  When you move your head back and forth while focusing on the center dot, the circles formed by rhombi appear to rotate, creating an illusion of movement.

- **Bulging Lines Illusion:**  
  In this illusion, the user can choose between two color schemes:
  - **GLWB (Gray-Light Gray-White-Black):** The lines appear to bulge outward from the center.
  - **GLBW (Gray-Light Gray-Black-White):** The lines seem to bend inward towards the center.  
  Hovering over the image reveals that the lines are actually straight, and the illusion is created by the surrounding elements.

With many more illusions available, the Illusion Box offers a fascinating and interactive way to explore how visual perception can be tricked. Users can interact with the illusions, and navigate through multiple sections to view different types of illusions.

### Pascal Triangle Visualization Activity | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sugarlabs/pascal-triangle-visualisation)

The **Pascal Triangle Visualization Activity** provides an interactive and customizable way to explore the properties of Pascalâ€™s Triangle. This activity allows users to visualize the triangle with various settings and experiment with its structure by modifying parameters like **modulo**, **number of rows**, and the **player** setting.

**Features and Gameplay:**
- **Modulo Function:**  
  Players can select a modulo value that defines the digits displayed in each cell of the triangle. For example, selecting modulo 3 will generate a triangle filled with the digits 0, 1, and 2.
  
- **Rows:**  
  The number of rows in the triangle can be customized, allowing players to view smaller or larger triangles depending on their preference.

- **Cell Calculation:**  
  Each cell of the triangle is calculated based on its two neighboring cells from the row above, using the formula:  
  `p = (q1 + q2) mod N`  
  Where **p** is the value of the current cell, **q1** and **q2** are the values of the two neighboring cells from the previous row, and **N** is the modulo value.

- **Interactive Exploration:**  
  Users can click on individual cells to see additional properties and patterns emerge, making the exploration of Pascal's Triangle a fun and educational experience.

With its engaging features, the **Pascal Triangle Visualization Activity** provides a fascinating way for users to interact with mathematical concepts and gain a deeper understanding of this important mathematical structure.

### Fourier Transform Visualization Activity | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sugarlabs/fourier-series-visulaisation)

The **Fourier Transform Visualization Activity** is an engaging educational tool designed to help users explore the principles of Fourier transforms and Fourier series. This interactive application allows users to manipulate visual elements to better understand how complex waveforms can be represented as a sum of simple sinusoidal functions.

**Features and Functionality:**

- **Circle Adjustment:**  
  Users can increase or decrease the number of circles displayed in the visualization. The number of circles corresponds to the accuracy of the Fourier series representation; more circles result in a more accurate approximation of the target waveform, while fewer circles provide a more simplified version. This feature allows users to see how the complexity of the representation affects the final output.

- **Frequency Control:**  
  The activity includes a frequency adjustment option, enabling users to increase or decrease the frequency of the displayed waveforms. Changing the frequency alters the number of oscillations within the same time frame, demonstrating the relationship between frequency and wave shape. Users can observe how higher frequencies create more rapid oscillations, while lower frequencies produce smoother, slower waves.

- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  As users modify the number of circles and the frequency, the visualization updates in real-time. This immediate feedback helps users understand how different parameters influence the construction of waveforms, allowing for an intuitive exploration of Fourier transforms.

- **Educational Value:**  
  This interactive tool serves as a practical resource for students and enthusiasts alike, providing a hands-on approach to learning about Fourier analysis. By visualizing how complex signals are decomposed into their constituent frequencies, users gain a deeper appreciation for the applications of Fourier transforms in various fields, including signal processing, acoustics, and image analysis.

Through this engaging and user-friendly interface, the **Fourier Transform Visualization Activity** encourages exploration and experimentation, making the intricate concepts of Fourier analysis accessible to learners of all ages.
